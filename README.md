| Currently understanding the art of Operating System Kernels because apparently "Hello World" wasn't challenging enough. obsessed with system programming languages.
Left brain (cache memory) is empty enough to store all programming languages syntaxs. Meanwhile, Right one was chilling with $$\bigcup_{k=1}^{n} \text{Pattern}_k$$ |
